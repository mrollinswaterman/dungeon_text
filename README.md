Hi guys! Welcome to Text Dungeon (or Dungeon Text, I haven't decided yet), a text-based dungeon crawler adventure game heavily based on DND & and Pathfinder, that is still in development. 

I am solo-developing this project, and I'm not 100% sure where it's going yet, so I don't have an end date in mind, 
but I'm going to keep working on it as long as I have the spare time and energy, so check back later for updates and stuff.

You're welcome to download the game files and check it out, although I feel obligated to warn you its nowhere near finished. 
The file you're going to want to run is tui.py. I run it from WSL using the command: "python3 tui.py" from inside the dungeon_text
folder, but as long as you run it from Terminal/Command Line that program should work fine. 

From there, I believe the gameplay is fairly self-explanitory, but if you have any questions feel free to email me at 
mrollinswaterman@uchicago.edu or miles.r.waterman@gmail.com

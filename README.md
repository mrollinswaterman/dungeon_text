Hi guys! Welcome to Text Dungeon (or Dungeon Text, I haven't decided yet), a text-based dungeon crawler adventure game heavily inspired by D&D and Pathfinder, that is still in development. 

I am solo-developing this project, and I'm not 100% sure where it's going yet, so I don't have an end date in mind, 
but I'm going to keep working on it as long as I have the spare time and energy, so check back later for updates and stuff.

You're welcome to download the game files and check it out, although I feel obligated to warn you its nowhere near finished. The 'playable' version of the game is
everything in the 'stable' folder, while 'src' contains the current, but potentially unstable version. 
The file you're going to want to run is stable/tui.py. I run it from WSL using the command: "python3 stable/tui.py" from inside the dungeon_text
folder, but as long as you run it from the Terminal/Command Line the program should work fine. 

From there, I believe the gameplay is fairly self-explanitory, but if you have any questions feel free to email me at

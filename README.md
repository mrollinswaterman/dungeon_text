Hi guys! Welcome to Text Dungeon (or Dungeon Text, I haven't decided yet), a text-based dungeon crawler adventure game heavily inspired by D&D and Pathfinder, that is still in development. 

I am solo-developing this project, and I'm not 100% sure where it's going yet, so I don't have an end date in mind, 
but I'm going to keep working on it as long as I have the spare time and energy, so check back later for updates and stuff.

**UPDATE AS OF 12/1/2024: Pardon my Dust!**
The project is currently not in a stable, playable state. I've been focusing all my energies on testing and building the GUI implementation, and as such
neither src nor stable are currently working. I hope to soon fix stable so that it a playable version of the game (albeit on the old Command-Line
interface), but right now, following the below instructions will not do you any good. 


~~You're welcome to download the game files and check it out, although I feel obligated to warn you its nowhere near finished. The "playable" version of the game is
everything in the 'stable' folder, while 'src' contains the current, but potentially unstable version.~~

~~**UPDATE AS OF 9/25/2024**
stable is currently not actually stable, I'm working on a fix to make it playable, but for now it has game breaking bugs~~

~~The file you're going to want to run is stable/tui.py. I run it from WSL using the command: "python3 stable/tui.py" from inside the dungeon_text
folder, but as long as you run it from the Terminal/Command Line the program should work fine.~~

~~From there, I believe the gameplay is fairly self-explanitory, but if you have any questions feel free to email me at 
mrollinswaterman@uchicago.edu or miles.r.waterman@gmail.com~~

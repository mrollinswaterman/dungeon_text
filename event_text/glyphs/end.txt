*You've stared at these pictures long enough. Time to move on.

*You gave it your best shot, better keep moving.

*You don't like standing still for too long. You give the glyphs one last look, then leave.

*If you can't understand them, they probably weren't worth translating in the first place. Right?

*You're fairly confident the glyphs don't hold any critical information anyway. You push them out of your mind and you continue your journey.
